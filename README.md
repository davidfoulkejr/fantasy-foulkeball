# Fantasy Foulkeball

### Overview

This project is a Web app I built to practice with Flask and SvelteKit. It is essentially
an NFL Scores app that shows the results of every NFL game from 2024, as well as a list of
every NFL teams with links to their schedules/results and rosters.

### Demo

I don't currently have a demo app running, but you can view it by cloning the repository 
and running the dev server using the commands below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidfoulkejr/fantasy-foulkeball.git
cd fantasy-foulkeball
yarn
yarn dev --open
```
